## Permissions

This directory stores all the permission files. Each file is associated with a [route](../routes) of the same name.

These files implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), meaning every user has a role and each role has different permissions. This is done so that users cannot access sensitive routes (such as ones for upoading dogs).
